# DIMENSIONAL WAREFARE
A local multiplayer game on PC with controllers.

## Welcome at DIMENSIONAL WAREFARE
This website is all about DIMENSIONAL WAREFARE, a game, that I started to build in a modul while studying IT and design at the Lucern University of Applied Siences and Arts. Because I faild to implement the core game play completly, I'd like to finish it in this mentoring project. In a talk with my mentor Guillaume Massol I decided on three goals to achive until the end of this semester.

### Goals
1. Complete implementation of the core game play
2. Simple orientation and overview for players
3. Learn more about Unity
