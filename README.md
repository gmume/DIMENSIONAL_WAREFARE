# DIMENSIONAL WAREFARE
A local multiplayer game on PC with controllers.

## Welcome at DIMENSIONAL WAREFARE
This website is all about DIMENSIONAL WAREFARE, a game, that I started to build in a modul while studying IT and design at the Lucern University of Applied Siences and Arts. Because I faild to implement the core game play completly, I'd like to finish it in this mentoring project. In a talk with my mentor Guillaume Massol I decided on three goals to achive until the end of this semester.

### Goals
1. Complete implementation of the core game play on one dimension
   * [x] Collision detection
   * [x] Hit detection
   * [x] Ships can sink
   * [x] Exclude sunk ships from further game 
3. Simple orientation and overview for players
   * [x] Visually show status of ships: activated/inactive, hit, sunk
   * [x] Zoom out to show all dimensions and ships at once
5. Learn more about Unity
   * [x] Debugging in Unity
   * [x] Information handling for classes

## Starting point
Up until now, you can play the start phace of DIMENSIONAL WAREFER and you can shoot at your opponents fleet, even there isn't a hit detection implemented yet. If you are courious about the building process until here, you can read about it on the game blog of Digital Ideation.

## 06.06.2023
Updated player swap: https://github.com/gmume/DIMENSIONAL_WAREFARE/blob/3d4b39d8474e041904f6eb93e2e17264be6164cf/Assets/Scripts/Fleet/Fleet.cs#L32-L48  
Active ships and cells are now working correctly.
Added script Player: https://github.com/gmume/DIMENSIONAL_WAREFARE/blob/ec4bcb8cd7c0edb313a01de77ddd0aab843572b2/Assets/Scripts/Multiplayer/Player.cs#L7-L53  
It holds all informations about the player, that other classes may need. Therefore it isn't necessary to set all properties separately in them anymore. 
Refactored properties.

## 06.06.2023
Refacturing: Transfered PlayerData, dimensions and fleet to Player.

## 12.06.2023
